Description
===========

Simple shell script to rename all Transmission destination paths at once (by
editing the resume files)

Usage
=====

transmission-batch-move [OPTIONS] PATTERN REPLACEMENT

It will search PATTERN (regex) and replace it with REPLACEMENT in all
destination properties of Transmission resume files in
~/.config/transmission/resume directory. Also, it will recalculate length of new
destination path, so resume file will not break. All original resume files are
moved to ~/.config/transmission/resume.orig. But for sure, backup the directory
yourself!

-h, --help

-y, --yes
Ignores the prompt to continue.

--path=CONFIG 
Specify path to your transmission config directory, which contains resume/
directory.
